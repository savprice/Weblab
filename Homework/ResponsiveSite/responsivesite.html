        <h3>Why is Proper Skincare Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Skincare is one of the most crucial parts of your everyday routine, and here's why:
              <ul>
                <li>Skin sheds itself daily</li>
                <li>All skin types are different</li>
                <li>Beautiful skin is a lifelong process (minimize wrinkles and lines in the future)</li>
                <li>Saves you money for the future</li>
                <li>When you look good, you feel good</li>
                <li>Help you establish other routines</li>
              </ul>

        <h3>Isn't it Expensive?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, and no. The first time you splurge on new skincare products, it can and will definitely put a dent in the bank account.
            However, once you purchase the products, they usually last for around 2-4 months, which gives you enough time to save up
            for when you need to repurchase. One of the reasons skincare is important is that it helps you save money for the future,
            meaning that if you take care of your skin from an early age, you won't experience the same issues you would in 35 years
            if you hadn't spent the extra money right now. For example, if you take care of your skin now, you can prevent many
            wrinkles and fine lines, which many people would spend hundreds of dollars on botox for. Trust me, it's worth it.

        <h3>What are the Steps in a Proper Skincare Routine?</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone has a different skincare routine, because everyone has unique skin. The routines that I am going to walk you
            through are my personal routines, yet they can be slightly modified to fit your personal needs. The two main parts of
            a skincare routine take place before you go to bed, and right after you wake up. If you click the links at the top,
            you can see detailed versions of my morning and night routines.
